Loader-Q
==============

Javascript Loader using the [Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) promises library [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) compatible.
This library is currently under development progress and the API and methods are likely to change in the near future.


## Example Code

#### TODO:

  * create id's from url instead of numeric, numerica could be an optional feature?
  * load assets other than image supported formats use XHR2 as in preloadjs?
  * cache flags for production make browser remembers the image for faster loading
  * Sequential Wrapper or sequential loader options with pause/resume
  * Events for asset manager start/loaded/total/fail
  * Events for each asset loaded start/progress/loaded/fail


#### Ideas

Cache layer storing on disk or localStorage for faster load especially for Projects where using PhoneGap and so on.
Perhaps own project, or extra AssetManager abstraction layer.
